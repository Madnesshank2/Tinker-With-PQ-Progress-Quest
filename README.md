# Tinker With PQ Progress Quest
Greetings to those that are reading this!

I am LoafGatrWitch or LGW for short.

# To dos
Note: This will be removed in the next update.
Current: 
- Add a change log to provide updates.
- Add License file.
- Possibly restructure and analyze the project to make this more managable.

# Details
This is merely a random side project that I have. I will be tinkering with the source code of Progress quest. Specifically, the web application verison of progress Quest.

I have been wanting to do this for a while. However, college work has been pushing it back. Whatever the case, I will be updating this place from time to time. Or at least whenever I have some time to work on it.

# Notes:
If you want to see the source code of PQ (Progress Quest) then click <a href = "https://bitbucket.org/grumdrig/pq-web" alt = "link to Progress Quest Web Application source code">here.</a>

I'll probably update more into this. I can assure that much.
