                <p>
                    Thanks to recent advances in technology, it has been possible to port
                    Progress Quest to run in your browser. You no longer need to download
                    or install anything to play Progress Quest; just hit the button:

                <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
                <p>
                    Does that sound easy to you? Well it wasn't; we started with hardware
                    emulation of a 80386-equipped PC clone running a novel Windows XP
                    compatable operating system called ProgrOS, implemented in a clean
                    room in the Seychelles by a team of people who had never programmed
                    before (to keep the lawyers at bay).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortuantely that wan't fast enough (there was too much lag death),
                    so we instead emulated the much faster Cray-2 supercomputer and ran
                    the 80386 emulator in that. But the 80386 kept getting hot, so we
                    switched to a 6502 overclocked at 120GHz with emulated liquid helium
                    coolant, and ported ProgrOS to that.

                <p>
                    This edition of the game is only single player - there is no Hall of
                    Fame yet. If anyone cares, that will come later.
